# InstaClone

A clone of Instagram's web UI using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5. The project started off using full stack
technologies but instead decided to just focus on the front-end side.

# Motivation

I wanted to learn new features of Bootstrap 5 and get some practice using my own CSS with it.

# Tech Stack

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* EJS
